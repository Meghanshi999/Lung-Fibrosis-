# Lung-Fibrosis-


Pulmonary = lung | fibrosis = scar tissue => Scarring in the lungs. Over time, scarring can destroy the normal lung and make it hard for oxygen to get into your blood. Pulmonary fibrosis isn’t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases that all look very much alike. We are going to predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. We will determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. We will use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
